(c) Michele Beltrame
--------------------

1.3.0 by Chan Chung Hang Christopher
  * Reworked qmhandle to be more accurate in reporting queue information (todo state, bouncing...)
  * Reworked qmhandle to be more efficient in handling message deletion when more than one message will be deleted
  * Added big-todo support (required since todo files need to be handled)
  * Added delete from sender support (both regular expression and string matching)
  * Added touch info file for messages to remote domain for earlier retry (at the cost of longer queue life)
  * Added delete if message header or body line matches regular expression (case sensitive and insensitive matching)
1.2.3
  * Fix: queue display transpose bug
1.2.2
  * Fix: added deletion routines to handle files in bounce subdirectory
  * Fix: added whitespace remove line for pidof output reported by Charlies (cng-oz)
1.2.1
  * Corrested an error in the README, and on in the HISTORY

1.2.0 (December 11, 2003)
  * CHANGED SWITCH NAME: "-m" is now used to view messages (no more "-v")
  * Added "-V" switch to print program version
  * Added switch to delete messages based on subject [thanks Arne Bernin]
  * Included GPL licence in the distribution
  * Now qmail is stopped only once for multiple deletions of messages, which
    makes things a bit faster
  * Corrected a bug which might have caused wrong messages to be deleted
  * Corrected several minor bugs

1.1.1 (July 10, 2003)
  * Corrected a bug which caused the -a switch not not work.

1.1.0 (June 4, 2003)
  * First release as a Sourceforge.Net community project... development
    resumes!!!
  * Added -a option to immediately send queued messages.

1.0.0 (December 17, 2001)
  * Made several functional and stylish adjustments to the code.
    [Thanks Mike Marseglia]
  * Much better handling of start/stop: qmHandle now can use system scripts
    or DBJ daemontools if they are available. Also, it won't restart qmail
    if it wasn't running when qmHandle was called.
    [Thanks Philippe Gay]
  * Updated the documentation.
  * Finally named it version 1.0.0!!! Seems pretty stable, well I hope
    it is. ;-)

0.5.1 (July 23, 2001)
  * Added a -D option which deletes al message in both local and remote queue.
    [Thanks Kasper Holtze]
  * Fixed a bug with the CC field when displaying message list.
    [Thanks anonymous qmHandle user]

0.5.0 (May 11, 2001)
  * Added syntax check on message numbers passed to -v and -d, so that qmHandle
    does not stop qmail or lookup messages if the argument is not valid.
    [Thanks Bertu Barnard]
  * Formatted the code in a more "Perlish" way.
  * Added display of "Cc" fields in message list (-l).
  * Empty fields in message list -l are not shown anymore.

  * Added multiple paramters and actions support.
  * Added a more condensed queue display option.
  * The program now show statistics also when listing queues.

    command used to get qmail process id (needed when deleting messages).

0.3.0 (October 25, 1998):
  * Fixed to support qmail 1.03. If you're using an older version, be
    sure to change the $qmcmd variable if using previous version.
  * Now when listing messages also message size is displayed. Thanks
    to Jodok Sutterluety.

0.2.0 (May 18, 1998):
